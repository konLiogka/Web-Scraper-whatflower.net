# Web-Scraper-for-house-plants
Extracts Name and Info Link from whatflower.net and exports to xlsx file. No copyright or personal information issue as it only extracts those two things.

Very simple common code used for web scraping, changed a little to extract the information from that site. Maybe Ill do some updates in the future since its a very simple project for beginners. 

You will need the following libraries installed:

1. BeautifulSoup4
2. Pandas
3. Requests
4. Openpyxl

Can be installed with pip.
