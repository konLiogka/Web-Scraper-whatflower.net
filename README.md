# Web-Scraper-for-house-plants
Extracts Name and Info Link from whatflower.net and exports to xlsx file.

Very simple common code used for web scraping, changed a little to extract the information from that site. Maybe Ill do some updates in the future since its a very simple project fir beginners.

You will need the following libraries installed:

1. BeautifulSoup4
2. Pandas
3. Requests

Can be installed with pip.
